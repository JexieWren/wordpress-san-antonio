# Master Advanced WordPress Theme Development: Template Hierarchies, Classes, Hooks and Ajax like a Pro

Let's discuss something grand, Shall we? Something I use at work. This something is one of many industrial grade techniques I use at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/) ‘My WorkPlace’ Let’s explore techniques to create more customizable, reusable, and robust themes.

You will learn object-oriented coding with classes, optimize template hierarchies, utilize powerful theme hooks, integrate ajax, and gracefully interact with plugins. Master these skills to build professional-grade WordPress themes.

Here is an expanded 600+ word article about using a class-based architecture and mastering the WordPress template hierarchy:



Building maintainable, reusable code is important for any WordPress theme. Using an object-oriented approach with classes is a best practice that allows your code to be organized, readable and flexible. 

## Creating a Base Theme Class

A base theme class is a great way to initialize core theme functionality and hook logic into WordPress actions and filters. Here is a basic example:

```php
class MyTheme {

  public function __construct() {
    
    // Actions
    add_action('after_setup_theme', array($this, 'theme_setup'));
    
    // Filters
    add_filter('template_include', array($this, 'template_fallback'));

  }

  public function theme_setup() {

    // Theme setup code

  }

  public function template_fallback($template) {

    // Template fallback logic
    
    return $template;

  }

}

$mytheme = new MyTheme();
```
## Class-Based Architecture for Extensible Code

Putting initialization logic into the constructor keeps your theme classes clean and organized. Additional public methods handle specific tasks like theme setup, widget registration, template fallback and more.

### Extracting Reusable Components

Common theme elements like menus, site headers and footers can often be extracted out into their own classes for reuse across projects. 

```php
class MyTheme_Menu {

  public function __construct() {

    add_action('wp_nav_menu_items', array($this, 'add_menu_button'), 10, 2);

  }

  public function add_menu_button($items, $args) {

    if($args->theme_location == 'primary') {
      $items .= '<li><a href="#">Button</a></li>';  
    }

    return $items;

  }

}

new MyTheme_Menu;
```







Extracting elements into well-defined classes with single responsibilities keeps your code organized and prevents logic from leaking into templates.

## Mastering the Template Hierarchy

The template hierarchy is a powerful concept in WordPress that allows developers granular control over markup. Understanding it is key to creating flexible themes.

WordPress first searches for template files in increasing order of specificity, like `single.php`, `single-{post_type}.php`, `page-{slug}.php`. Child themes override parent templates, enabling drop-in customization.

Template parts allow modular reuse of common code without duplication. For example: 

```php
get_template_part('content', 'page'); 
```

Loads `content-page.php` to display page content. Template part files keep your templates lean.

Hooks provide surgical control over template markup. For instance, adding a banner to the front page:

```php 
add_filter('the_content', 'add_banner');
```

With classes, reusable elements, and a deep understanding of the template hierarchy, you can build maintainable themes with surgical control over all site markup.




Here is the expanded section with some additional subheadings:

## Hook Into Actions for Total Theme Control


WordPress actions provide access to modify behavior at specific times. For example: 

```php
function mytheme_setup() {
  // Theme setup
}

add_action('after_setup_theme', 'mytheme_setup');
```

This runs additional theme setup functions after the main setup routine. 

### Key Hook Points

There are several important hook points that allow themes to hook into different parts of the WordPress lifecycle:

#### init
The `init` hook runs code during initialization and is useful for hooking custom functionality early.

#### widgets_init 
Registering widget areas can be hooked with `widgets_init` to declare sidebar areas.

### wp_enqueue_scripts
Enqueueing scripts and styles is done on the `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook to properly load assets.

#### template_redirect
The `template_redirect` hook allows intercepting template loading to override files.

### Gaining Complete Control

By understanding WordPress hooks like actions and filters, developers can exert total control over a theme's behavior and outputs. Almost any functionality can be modified by hooking into the proper action or filter.

Some best practices include only hooking critical functions and keeping callbacks efficient. Documentation is also important so other developers understand how theme functions are hooked. 

With practice, themes can be built that are completely customizable through actions and filters alone. This facilitates creating themes that are extendable by other developers through plugins as well.

## Level Up With Advanced Ajax Techniques

### Infinite Scrolling 

Infinite scrolling removes pagination by loading new content as the user scrolls. This can be accomplished by:

1. Detecting scroll position with JavaScript
2. Fetching additional posts via Ajax 
3. Appending posts to page

This provides a seamless endless browsing experience.

### Live Filters & Search

Forms can be enhanced to filter results live without refreshing. For search:

```js
// Fetch on keyup
data = await fetch('/search?term='+term);

// Update results  
document.querySelector('#results').innerHTML = data; 
```

Now search is instantaneous. The same approach works for other filters.

### Load More Buttons 

A common pattern is to initially load a few posts, then provide a "Load More" button to get additional content:

```js
// Bind click handler 
button.addEventListener('click', getMore);

// Ajax fetch on click
function getMore() {
  // Fetch & append posts
}
```

This jumpstarts perceived performance while allowing on-demand loading.
